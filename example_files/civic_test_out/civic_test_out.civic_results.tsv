Mean tumor growth was lower in the tumors treated with AZD6244+ BEZ235 (+77% vs. +267%, P=1E-6) compared to AZD6244 alone and (+77% vs. +222%, P=0.0014) BEZ235 alone.

The amino acid positions G12, G13 and Q61 account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations. The isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, targeting these RAS mutants has also been very elusive, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic.	4893		NRAS G12V		0.0																					EID4465	In an in vitro study, a DiFi colorectal cancer cell line stably expressing NRAS G12V mutation demonstrated resistance to cetuximab treatment compared to DiFi cells expressing wild-type NRAS.
